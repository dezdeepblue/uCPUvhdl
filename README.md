# uCPUvhdl
An 8-bit data, 16-bit instruction load-store 2 pipeline stage CPU with 7 GPRs

muCPU - first vhdl version of the processor has only 3 gprs

muCPUv2 - second version

The formatting of the VHDL code is messy because the tab size is different for the IDE than it is for Github (add ?ts=3 to the end of the url when viewing the .vhd files)
